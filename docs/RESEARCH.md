## üß© The Problem: A Significant Need in a Growing Community

### üìà Large and Active Market
Hackathons are growing in popularity and scale:
- Microsoft‚Äôs annual Hackathon attracted **18,304 participants** across **400 cities** and **75 countries**.
- PennApps, a student-run event, hosted over **2,000 participants**.
- Foursquare‚Äôs global hackathon saw over **500 developers** in **30+ sites**.

This massive participation highlights the need for better **team formation tools**.

---

### üõë Current Methods Are Inefficient
Most hackathons rely on Discord or Slack intros, where:
- Messages get lost in noise
- Shy participants are overlooked
- Connections depend heavily on luck

Quote from user pain:
> "Awkward Discord intros or missed connections make it hard to find the right people to build with."

---

### ‚ùå High Rates of Team Dissolution
In one hackathon:
- 50 participants started
- Only 26 completed their projects

Dropouts left others **"practically alone at the end"**, which harms experience, progress, and motivation.  
Group commitment is a major issue.

---

### üí¨ Communication & Collaboration Problems
Participants and organizers frequently cite:
- Poor coordination
- Misaligned time zones
- Personality conflicts
- Disrespectful or incompatible teammates

---

### ‚è∞ Desire for Pre-Event Team Building
Organizers emphasize the need for:
- Pre-event interaction
- Personality and skills-based matching
- Self-assessments of team behavior and goals

This could improve both event experience and project quality.
