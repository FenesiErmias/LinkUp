# LinkUp  — Match Teammates, Not Just Projects

**LinkUp** is a web app that helps hackathon and event attendees find the **right people to build with** — based on their goals, skills, interests, and vibes. No more awkward Discord intros or missed connections. Just swipe, match, and **LinkUp**.

## 🔍 What It Does

At most hackathons, forming a team is one of the biggest challenges. Discord "intro" channels are often flooded, messy, and easy to get lost in. LinkUp fixes that.

### 🔗 How it works:
1. **Create a Profile** – Add your skills, interests, hackathon goals, timezone, and preferred tech stack.
2. **Swipe on People** – Get matched with others based on compatibility (mutual interest = a match!).
3. **Connect on Discord** – When two people match, LinkUp automatically connects their Discord handles so they can friend each other and chat.
4. **(Optional)** Join teams, set status (Looking / In a Team), or explore others’ project ideas.

## 🧩 How We Built It

The idea for LinkUp came from real hackathon pain:  
> “I introduced myself, but no one saw it. I just want to meet someone who wants to build cool stuff with me.”

Using simple swipes and meaningful profiles, LinkUp reimagines team-building as something **fun**, **fast**, and **personal** — like a dating app, but for friendship and collaboration.
